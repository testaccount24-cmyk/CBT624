//***FILE 624 is from Bob Glover and contains a very useful TSO     *   FILE 624
//*           REXX command to FIND datasets by name, whether they   *   FILE 624
//*           are cataloged or not, on a given set of disk packs.   *   FILE 624
//*           There is also a standalone command included, called   *   FILE 624
//*           TSOUCB, which will display all the disk packs in      *   FILE 624
//*           your system by their names.  TSOUCB is sometimes      *   FILE 624
//*           used in conjunction with the FIND REXX, but it will   *   FILE 624
//*           also function by itself.                              *   FILE 624
//*                                                                 *   FILE 624
//*           An important note in running this FIND REXX, is that  *   FILE 624
//*           your TSO session has to be able to issue              *   FILE 624
//*                                                                 *   FILE 624
//*              CALL IDCAMS                                        *   FILE 624
//*                                                                 *   FILE 624
//*           in APF authorized mode.  For this to happen, you      *   FILE 624
//*           have to include the name IDCAMS in your AUTHPGM       *   FILE 624
//*           NAMES( ) section of IKJTSOxx in PARMLIB, or the       *   FILE 624
//*           equivalent.  See member $README for mention of some   *   FILE 624
//*           other ways to accomplish the same thing.              *   FILE 624
